The 2.0.0 release is codenamed "Doug" in honour of [Doug Nebert](http://www.opengeospatial.org/blog/2038) of the FGDC. Doug was internationally recognized as a champion of metadata, discovery and interoperability.  Involved in numerous international standards bodies and spatial data infrastructure initiatives, Doug was one of the editors of the CSW 3.0 specification and encouraged pycsw developers to adopt and implement CSW 3.0 as part of US [data.gov](https://data.gov) efforts. Dougâ€™s vision and expertise will always be remembered and appreciated by the pycsw development team.

pycsw is an OGC CSW server implementation written in Python.

pycsw fully implements the OpenGIS Catalogue Service Implementation Specification (Catalogue Service for the Web). Initial development started in 2010 (more formally announced in 2011). The project is certified OGC Compliant, and is an OGC Reference Implementation. Since 2015, pycsw is an official OSGeo Project.

pycsw allows for the publishing and discovery of geospatial metadata. Existing repositories of geospatial metadata can also be exposed via numerous APIs (CSW 2/CSW 3, OpenSearch, OAI-PMH, SRU), providing a standards-based metadata and catalogue component of spatial data infrastructures.

pycsw is Open Source, released under an MIT license, and runs on all major platforms (Windows, Linux, Mac OS X).
