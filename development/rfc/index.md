# Request for Comments (RFC)

An RFC is a memorandum describing methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet and Internet-connected systems. It is submitted either for peer review or simply to convey new concepts, information, or (occasionally) engineering humor. The IETF adopts some of the proposals published as RFCs as Internet standards.

An RFC describes a major change in the technological underpinnings of
MapServer, major additions to functionality, or changes in the direction of
the project.
