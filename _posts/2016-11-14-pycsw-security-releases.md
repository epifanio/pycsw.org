The pycsw team announces the release of pycsw 2.0.2, 1.10.5 and 1.8.6.

This is a security release to mitigate an SQL injection vulnerability
when using CQL or SRU mode queries ([CVE-2016-8640](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-8640)).

You are strongly recommended to update pycsw to the latest stable
