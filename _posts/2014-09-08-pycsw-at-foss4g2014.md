If you're at [FOSS4G 2014](http://2014.foss4g.org), be sure to check pycsw in the following presentations and workshops:

- [Data.gov/Geoplatform.gov CSW implementation through pycsw and CKAN integration](https://2014.foss4g.org/schedule/sessions/) given by [Angelos](http://users.ntua.gr/tzotsos/) (Thursday 11 September, Session 2, Track 1), which will discuss the implementation of the CSW endpoint using pycsw within the Data.gov infrastructure (architecture/enhancements/testing/deployment) and CKAN, which powers Data.gov and Geoplatform.gov
- we will be meeting at the [OSGeo Code Sprint](https://2014.foss4g.org/schedule/code-sprint/).  Specific pycsw items listed at [http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSS4G_2014_Code_Sprint#pycsw](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSS4G_2014_Code_Sprint#pycsw).
