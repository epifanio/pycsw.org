The pycsw development team is happy to announce that pycsw 1.10 is now 
certified OGC Compliant for OGC CSW 2.0.2 [1], and passes all CITE 
tests.

In addition, pycsw 1.10 is now an official OGC Reference Implementation. A 
demonstration instance of the reference implementation is available at 
http://demo.pycsw.org.

"Reference Implementations are an important piece of community compliance
tools," said Luis Bermudez, Executive Director Compliance and E-Learning,
Open Geospatial Consortium.  "They not only support OGC verifying that
new releases of the tests are not breaking previous implementations, but
also provide practical help to new developers that want to implement the
standard.  pycsw has been Reference Implementation of CAT 2.0 for over 2
years since version 1.4.  OGC appreciates the effort of the OSGeo community
to keep pycsw compliant with the current CAT 2.0 test."

Standards are at the core of pycsw; acheiving OGC compliance and 
reference implementation status is part of the project's ongoing 
commitment to an open source, standards-based metadata and catalogue 
component of spatial data infrastructures.

pycsw is an OGC Compliant CSW server implementation written in Python.
