## 10 years -- Happy birthday pycsw! ðŸŽ‰

This year (02 December) marks the 10th anniversary of the pycsw project.  From
the [initial commit](https://github.com/geopython/pycsw/commit/2025ff4b5a00ef97ffadb9f53075df84bf03e697)
on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pycsw/), and subsequent
[announcement](https://kralidis.ca/blog/2011/02/04/help-wanted-baking-a-csw-server-in-python),
of the project, pycsw has evolved into a stable, production ready and core
spatial data infrastructure (SDI) component for disseminating metadata via the
OGC CSW specification.

pycsw powers numerous high profile open data / SDI activities, including US
Data.gov, LINZ, Geodata.gov.gr, IOOS, NOAA, WMO WOUDC, UN WFP, Copernicus and
GEOSS.  The flexible nature of the project has also resulted in integration
with leading open data management systems such as CKAN and GeoNode.

From day one, pycsw has always strived to be OGC Compliant.  The project
continues to be a leading OGC Reference Implementation of CSW.  In addition,
pycsw continues as a long standing OSGeo project and a core component of the
growing ecosystem of [geopython](https://geopython.github.io) projects for the
open source geospatial community.

## Future plans

The project will continue to evolve into the future.  pycsw's flexible nature
will continue to support new metadata formats, as well as integration with
downstream applications.  To support OGC CSW as a baseline OGC web service
specification, as well as the evolving OGC API efforts to modernize web service
APIs, pycsw will continue to support CSW 2/3, as well as the emerging
OGC API - Records specification.

Thank you to the pycsw community, OSGeo, OGC and beyond for your support
and use of our lightweight, flexible and OGC compliant metadata catalogue
server -- happy birthday pycsw!

Sincerly
